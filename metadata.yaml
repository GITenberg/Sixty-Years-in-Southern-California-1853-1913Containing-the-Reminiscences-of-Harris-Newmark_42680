description: Harris Newmark (1834-1916), son of a modest Prussian Jewish merchant,
  sailed to America in 1853 to join his older brother in Los Angeles. He made a fortune
  in real estate, the wholesale grocery business, and hides and wools, becoming a
  leader in the local Jewish community and the city at large. Sixty years in Southern
  California (1916) begins with his description of Los Angeles as he found it; judges
  and lawyers, merchants and shops, churches and other landmarks. In the chapters
  that follow, Newmark organizes his materials chronologically and outlines his various
  mercantile partnerships and traces changing patterns of social life in Los Angeles,
  political factions, railroad construction in southern California, crime and vigilantism,
  the Chinese Massacre of 1871, and real estate speculations. In a more personal vein,
  he chronicles Jewish family life and philanthropy.
